Hola! My name is Gonzalo, I'm originally from Viña del Mar, Chile. I am interested in the intersection between data science and public policy. I'm currently finishing a Master in Public Administration at [Harvard University](https://hks.harvard.edu), and I'm a Gleitsman Leadership Fellow at the [Center of Public Leadership](https://cpl.hks.harvard.edu). I'm also a Research Assistant for Professor [Dan Levy](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty/dan-levy). I graduated as an engineer with a major in computer science from Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile in 2016.

Before coming to Harvard, I taught maths to high school students as part of [Enseña Chile](https://ensenachile.cl) (2017-2018), and then worked in the intersection between data and policy in the Ministry of Education (2019). Last year, I took a one-year leave of absence from the MPA to work in Chile's COVID-19 response at the Ministry of Health (2020-2021.) 

I love running :running_man:, playing piano :musical_keyboard:, especially improvising blues with friends, and trying new food.
