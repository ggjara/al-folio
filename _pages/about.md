_Hola!_  My name is Gonzalo, I'm originally from Chile. I am a computer scientist interested in the intersection between data science, AI, and public policy.  I'm currently CTO of [DFundamental](https://dfundamental.com), a data consulting firm, and a Research Fellow at [EPoD](https://epod.cid.harvard.edu), the center of Evidence for Policy Design at Harvard University.

Last year, I graduated from the Master in Public Administration at Harvard, where I was a [Gleitsman Leadership Fellow](https://cpl.hks.harvard.edu/gleitsman-leadership-fellowship), and a Research Assistant to [Dan Levy](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty/dan-levy).

Before my master, I taught maths to high school students as part of [Ense√±a Chile (Teach for All)](https://ensenachile.cl) (2017-2018), and then worked as data scientist at the Ministry of Education (2019). In 2021 I was part of Chile's COVID-19 response, where I led an engineering team and worked alongside academia to create software and mathematical models to support data-driven decision making of the President, Ministers, and government officials nationwide.

I love running :running_man: and playing piano :musical_keyboard:, especially improvising blues with friends.
