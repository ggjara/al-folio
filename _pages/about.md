_Hola!_  My name is Gonzalo, I'm originally from Viña del Mar, Chile, and I am interested in the intersection between data science and public policy. 

I'm currently CTO of [DFundamental](https://dfundamental.com), a data science consulting firm, and a Research Fellow at [EPoD](https://epod.cid.harvard.edu), the center of Evidence for Policy Design at the [Harvard Kennedy School](https://hks.harvard.edu).

In 2022 I graduated from the Master in Public Administration at Harvard, where I was also a [Gleitsman Leadership Fellow](https://cpl.hks.harvard.edu/gleitsman-leadership-fellowship) at the [Center of Public Leadership](https://cpl.hks.harvard.edu), and a Research Assistant to [Dan Levy](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty/dan-levy). In 2016 I graduated as a computer science engineer from Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile.

Before coming to Harvard, I taught maths to high school students as part of [Enseña Chile](https://ensenachile.cl) (2017-2018), and then worked as data scientist at the Ministry of Education (2019). During 2021/2022 I took a one-year leave of absence to work in Chile's COVID-19 response at the Ministry of Health. There, I led a data science team whose goal was to work alongside academia to create tools and models to improve data-driven decision making.

I love running :running_man:, playing piano :musical_keyboard:, especially improvising blues with friends, and trying new food :ramen:
