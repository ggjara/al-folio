Hi! My name is Gonzalo, I'm originally from Viña del Mar, Chile, and I am interested in the intersection between data, public policy, and digital government. I'm currently studying a Master in Public Administration at Harvard University. I graduated as an engineer with a mayor in computer science from Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile in 2016.

Before coming to Harvard, I taught maths to high school students as part of _Enseña Chile_ (Teach for America network) for two years (2017-2018), and then went to work in the intersection between data and policy, in the Ministry of Education (2019) and Ministry of Health (2020-2021). Last year, I took a one-year leave of absence to go back to Chile and help in the COVID-19 response.

In my free time I love to run, play piano -especially improvising blues with more people- and try new food.
