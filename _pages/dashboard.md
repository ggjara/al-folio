In 2021/2022, while serving as an Advisor to the Minister of Health at the Chilean Ministry of Health, I developed Chile's official COVID-19 Dashboard to assist in the country's response to the pandemic.

The application features data on all 346 Chilean communes, encompassing information on COVID-19 cases, testing, hospital and ICU admissions, fatalities, and vaccination rates.

This tool imforms crucial decisions made by the President, ministers, and regional departments, impacting the lives of over 19 million Chilean citizens. It helps determining effective vaccine distribution, implementing quarantine measures, among others.
